You are Replit Agent. Build an MVP MOBILE APP inspired by the learning loop of Mimo (bite-sized lessons, interactive exercises with instant feedback, streaks, XP, skill paths, projects, progress tracking) but for FINANCIAL LEARNING (educational only, not financial advice). Name it “FinMimo” (placeholder).

PLATFORM / STACK (mobile-first)
- Mobile: React Native with Expo + TypeScript (one codebase for iOS + Android)
- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript (Express) running in the same Replit project
- DB: Postgres (use Replit Postgres if available; otherwise SQLite for dev, but keep schema portable)
- ORM: Prisma
- Auth: Email/password with JWT + refresh tokens (simple MVP). Store tokens securely on device (expo-secure-store).
- AI: OpenAI-compatible SDK via backend only (never call AI directly from the client). Use env vars for keys.

GOALS (MVP)
1) User can sign up/login, choose a learning path, complete lessons with interactive questions and immediate feedback, earn XP, maintain a daily streak, and see progress.
2) Admin can create/edit/publish paths/skills/lessons/exercises/projects via a simple admin API + an “Admin Mode” screen in the mobile app (role-protected).
3) Include an AI Tutor chat screen that is context-aware (current lesson + user mistakes), can generate extra practice, and has strict guardrails (refuse financial advice).
4) Seed at least one complete path in DB: “Personal Finance Foundations” with 5 skills, each skill has 6 lessons (≈30 lessons total) and 1 project per skill (guided forms).

APP SCREENS & FLOWS
A) Onboarding
- Welcome → Sign up / Log in
- Choose daily goal: 5 / 10 / 15 minutes
- Choose focus: Budgeting / Debt / Investing basics / Markets
- Optional quick placement quiz (5 questions) → store level

B) Main Navigation (Bottom Tabs)
Tabs: Home | Learn | Practice | Projects | Profile

C) Home
- Continue Learning card (next lesson)
- Daily goal progress ring (lessons completed today)
- Streak counter + “streak freeze” (1 free freeze per 14 days in MVP)
- XP today + total XP
- Button: Open Tutor (AI)

D) Learn (Path Map)
- Show Path list; start with one path.
- Path detail: 5 skills as nodes; sequential unlocking.
- Skill detail: 6 lessons + “Skill Quiz” at end.

E) Lesson Player
- Lesson is a series of cards:
  - short read cards + interactive exercise cards
- Exercise types (MVP):
  1) Multiple choice
  2) True/False
  3) Numeric input (validate with ranges)
- Immediate feedback: correct/incorrect + explanation + hint + retry
- Track attempts and mastery; unlock next lesson on completion.

F) Practice
- “Spaced repetition-lite” queue: prioritize incorrect/low mastery exercises
- 10-question session; award XP

G) Projects (Guided)
Each skill has 1 project that outputs a saved artifact shown in Profile.
Projects (MVP as forms + computed summaries):
1) Monthly Budget Builder (income, fixed, variable) → summary + ratios
2) Emergency Fund Plan (target months, timeline) → plan summary
3) Debt Payoff Simulator (snowball/avalanche) → schedule table
4) Investing Simulator (DCA vs lump sum, assumed return slider) → outcomes
5) Retirement Projection (age, contribution, assumed return) → projection
Hard rule: show “Educational simulation only” on each project.

H) AI Tutor (Chat Screen)
- A chat UI called “Tutor”
- Tutor sees context: current path/skill/lesson, current exercise prompt, user last attempts, and concept tags
- Tutor can: explain in simple terms, provide analogies, step-by-step, generate extra practice questions, and review project inputs EDUCATIONALLY.

GUARDRAILS (MUST IMPLEMENT)
- The app is educational only, NOT financial advice. Always show disclaimer in Tutor and Projects.
- If user asks: “what should I invest in / buy / sell / best stock / what coin / give me picks”:
  - Refuse politely
  - Provide general education + risk considerations + suggest licensed advisor
  - Offer to teach how to evaluate options instead
- No personalized investment recommendations. No promises of returns.

Implement guardrails server-side:
- /server/src/ai/guardrails.ts: intent rules (regex + heuristics) and safe responses
- Only call the AI model if allowed by guardrails
- If no AI key, Tutor works in fallback mode: canned explanations + lesson hints + extra practice from templates.

GAMIFICATION RULES
- XP: lesson completion +5, correct answer +2, project completion +20, practice session +15
- Streak increments when daily goal met by local date; breaks if missed unless freeze used
- Achievements: First Lesson, 3-day streak, First Project

DATA MODEL (Prisma)
- User (id, email, passwordHash, role, createdAt)
- UserProfile (userId, dailyGoalMinutes, timezone, preferencesJson)
- Path (id, title, description, order)
- Skill (id, pathId, title, description, order)
- Lesson (id, skillId, title, order, contentJson, isPublished)
- Exercise (id, lessonId, type, prompt, optionsJson, answerJson, explanation, hint, tagsJson)
- Attempt (id, userId, exerciseId, answerJson, isCorrect, createdAt)
- Progress (id, userId, skillId, lessonId, status, masteryScore, updatedAt)
- Streak (userId, current, longest, lastActiveDate, freezeCount, updatedAt)
- XPEvent (id, userId, type, amount, createdAt)
- Project (id, skillId, title, schemaJson)
- ProjectSubmission (id, projectId, userId, dataJson, createdAt)
- Achievement + UserAchievement

SEED CONTENT (required)
Seed DB with:
Path: “Personal Finance Foundations”
Skills (5):
1) Budgeting Basics
2) Saving & Emergency Funds
3) Debt & Credit Fundamentals
4) Investing Fundamentals
5) Risk & Long-term Planning
Each skill: 6 lessons (short titles) + a handful of exercises spread across lessons (keep coherent).
Each skill: 1 project with schemaJson that the mobile UI can render.

BACKEND API (Express)
Auth:
- POST /auth/signup
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/refresh
- POST /auth/logout

Content:
- GET /paths
- GET /paths/:id
- GET /skills/:id
- GET /lessons/:id (only published unless admin)
- GET /practice/queue

Learning actions:
- POST /attempts (grade exercise; return feedback)
- POST /lessons/:id/complete (award XP, update progress)
- POST /projects/:id/submit (save artifact; award XP)

Stats:
- GET /me (profile, progress, streak, xp)
- GET /leaderboard/weekly (optional)

Admin (role-protected):
- CRUD endpoints for paths/skills/lessons/exercises/projects
- Publish/unpublish lessons

AI:
- POST /ai/tutor (context + message) → guardrails → model call or safe refusal

MOBILE APP IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Expo Router for navigation OR React Navigation (choose one, be consistent)
- State: React Query for API caching + Zustand for local UI state (optional)
- Secure storage: expo-secure-store for tokens
- Offline: cache last opened lessons and user progress locally (AsyncStorage) and sync attempts when online (basic queue is enough for MVP)
- UI: clean, minimal, card-based lesson player, progress rings, streak badge

REPO LAYOUT (MONOREPO)
- /mobile (Expo app)
- /server (Express API)
- /prisma (schema, migrations, seed)
- Root README with setup

ENV VARS
- DATABASE_URL
- JWT_SECRET
- AI_API_KEY (optional)
- AI_BASE_URL (optional)

DELIVERABLES
1) Working Expo app (runs in iOS/Android simulator via Expo)
2) Working Express backend in Replit + Prisma migrations + seed script
3) Admin mode screen (protected) to create/edit/publish content
4) AI Tutor screen with guardrails and fallback
5) README: how to run server + mobile, how to migrate/seed, how to create an admin user

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
1) Scaffold monorepo (Expo + Express)
2) Prisma schema + migrations + seed content
3) Auth (JWT + secure storage) end-to-end
4) Learn path map + lesson player + exercise grading
5) XP/streak/progress
6) Practice
7) Projects
8) Admin mode
9) AI tutor + guardrails + fallback

Start now by scaffolding the Expo app and Express API, then implement Prisma + seed so the app can fetch the path and render the first lesson.
